# MideaIR

### Introduction

The remote control of Midea Air Conditioner have a UI point of view,
synchronizating commands on the remote control with the Air Conditioner,
this implies in the following problem: you can't emit only one command
you need to emit a pack of commands, even if you only just want to change
the temperature, the only independent command on Midea Air Conditioner
is the command to turn off, all the others including the turn on need
to be concatenated.

In order to solve this problem, this library provide an object that
simulate the interface present on the remote control.

### How to Use?
